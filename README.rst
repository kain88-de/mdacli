  CLI tools to work with GROMACS Simulations
=============================================

The g_tools implemented in GROMACS make some things that should be easy
unnecessarily complex. This is a small set of CLI tools for myself writtin in MDAnalysis
to help use GROMACS. I hope it's useful for others too.

Installation
============

.. code::

    python setup.py install --user
